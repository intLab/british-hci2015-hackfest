bio: I am a self taught python/javascript developer with experience working for start-ups, currently half way through a Msc in Science and Tecnology in Society at University of Edinburgh. My undergrad was in Social Anthropology, so hopefully I can bring some different perspectives to the table! I am particularly interested in ideas and implementations of the commons, both 'digital' and in the 'real' world. The focus on the Magna Carta appeals to enthusiasm for social histories. When not studying or working I juggle several ridiculous projects, including generative art, 3d printing/robotics, and a spot of political/community activism. If I have a life aim it is to try to replace the American style 'libertarianism' that dominates tech culture with the original, European, concept of libertarianism, with its roots in socialist and anarchist thought.
