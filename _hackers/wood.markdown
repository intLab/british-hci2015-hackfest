bio: "PhD Student on the Creative Exchange Project at Newcastle University. Prior to research I worked in the computer games industry for 12 years where I held positions ranging from games designer, graphics programmer and physics programmer before finalising my role as the technical lead of a small games studio. This experience included AA titles developed for PS3, Xbox and Wii and included feature films and world sporting events. I left the games industry but continue to blog and release indie games for iOS and Windows PC under the name BaaWolf. Games like Thatgamecompanyâ€™s Flower, and Osmos from Hemisphere Games continue to inspire my interest in this field. I entered into research three years ago and began to apply gaming technology and experience to creating digital prototypes. Magic Land: The Design and Evaluation of an Interactive Tabletop Supporting Therapeutic Play with Children used my own game engine and toolset to deliver a robust and polished digital prototype allowing research to concentrate on the important elements like producing new opportunities for play. I am continuing to develop innovative gaming technologies as my research agenda begins to focus on the experience of play in digital technologies."
